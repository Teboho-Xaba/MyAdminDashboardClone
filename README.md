# MyAdminDashboard

This is the first time I've made a dashboard without watching a tutorial or using any framework. It was an interesting challenge and I had fun doing it! The code for this was strictly HTML and CSS, and focused mostly on the grid.

# HUGE CHALLENGE

The biggest challenges I faced was creating a sidebar and main section, my failure in the previous attempts was:

- creating a set width for the sidebar without using the grid, in essence I was working backward
- trying to make the content area is responsive to screen size changes. This was a huge mistake as I couldn't even get the sidebar right, this my end-result would be clustered work.

# Positives

- I am now able to use the grid efficiently and effectively
- I can, at the very least, create skeleton projects using different aspects of the languages, in this case flexbox and grid.
